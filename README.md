##This Python code builds a **movie recommendation system** using collaborative filtering techniques. It loads movie ratings data and constructs a user-item rating matrix, then computes **user and item similarities** using cosine similarity. To improve predictions, it applies **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for matrix factorization, reducing the data to latent features and reconstructing predicted ratings. The final model's performance is evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to measure the difference between actual and predicted ratings.
